  _questDescription: Hello again. Remeber the guy you found? Yeah, the dead one on
    the gas station. Did he have a bag with him, the blue one, like an ice bag? No?
    Hm... Okay. Could you make a lil' errand for me? I need you to go to the Red
    Forest National Park and check for a stash of mine, maybe he left the bag in
    there. Oh and I have a list of stuff that in there, so don't even think about
    anything.
