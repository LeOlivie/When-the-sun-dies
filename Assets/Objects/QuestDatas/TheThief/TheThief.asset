  _questDescription: 'Hey man, can I trust you? Would you do anything I ask you?
    I guess you are not some liar and we can do business together. Listen in then:
    one guy of mine has betrayed me and has stolen my stuff. Others are already "teaching"
    him not to steal again, but someone still needs to return what he took. Would
    you do it? His stash is located in the National Park, probably in the toilets.
    Hah, come to think of it, if he tried to hide stuff in there, then he''s even
    dumber than I thought. Anyway, I need you to go there and return my things. By
    the way, feel free to take some loot from his stash in the process, bastard has
    to know who he is dealing with.'
