  _questName: What happened? - Part 2
  _questDescription: I've read the newspaper you found in the store, almost no useful
    information, all we know right now is that the scientists few days before discovered
    some kind of a strange fenomenon in space, but nothing more specific. Our next
    clue is my old friend, he was keen on astrology and could spent all day whatching
    in his telescope. I guess he would spot something interesting. I need you to
    go at his place and look around, maybe he wrote something. Have you seen the
    apartment complex in the streets? The 4 stories one, yes.
