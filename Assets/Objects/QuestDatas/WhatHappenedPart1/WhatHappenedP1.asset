  _questDescription: Hey man, have you even heard a reason why the sun has begun
    to kill us? That's right, I haven't as well, but we have to live with it. Could
    you check the bookshop for any information about that? Some newspapers maybe
    or some other stuff that could help. Not for free of course.
