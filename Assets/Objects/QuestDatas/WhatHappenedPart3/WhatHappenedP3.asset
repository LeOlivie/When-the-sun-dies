  _questDescription: Hm... That's strange... Oh, you are here, hello. That guy surely
    knew something, but... Look here. See? Some pages are torn away. He didn't want
    to believe what he saw, perhaps? Yeah, not much of a help. Huh. There's a drawing...
    Some kind of an analyzer? Interesting. That could work. But I'm a few things
    short, could you help with that? Thanks a lot. We may be onto something...
