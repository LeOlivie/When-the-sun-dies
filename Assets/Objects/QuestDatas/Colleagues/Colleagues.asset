  _questDescription: 'Hey there, Traveller. Looking for a job? Okay, listen in then:
    a few days ago I''ve sent one of my boys on a scavenging mission to the gas station
    near the city to get some food, meds, you know. But he never came back, probably
    dead already.  However I have a feeling that experienced guy like him wouldn''t
    die simply ''cause of a sun. Could check, what happened to him? I''ll give some
    stuff as payment, of course.'
